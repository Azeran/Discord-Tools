Hey Discord Tools here.

I recommend you to use a Virtual Machine or the included Sanbox for the following programs.
You will be able to run programs without them acessing your system. Viruses won't be able
to harm your computer then.

These files are not mine. I did not code or work on them. I provide the files only for disposal. 

I were able to decrypt the Source Code for most of these Files and they were harmless but still, please note that I am not responsible for any damages.

If you experience any kind of malware or virus behavior contact me immediately at Baseult@gmail.com so I can remove the threat from the discord pack.

I am not responsible for any actions you perform with the Following Files.
I am not responsible for any damage, caused by your following actions.
Use it at your own risk.
